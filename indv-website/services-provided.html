    <p class="desc-services1"> A hoarding is a very large board at the side of a road or on the side of a building, which is used for displaying advertisements and posters. It is very good way of advertising your services and products to wide range of people. It is generally little costlier then normal sign boards and banners, becasue it requires lots of man power and time for making.</p>

    <div class="heading-services2">Pre-School Decorations</div>
    <div class="image2-services"></div>
        <img class="image2-services" src="Images/pre-school-classroom.jpg" alt="Smily" width="200" height="150">
    <p class="desc-services2"> This is yhe era of children, they are the future and how we teach them, raise them depends what they become. I, as an artist, try to fullfil small portion of my responsibility to help them learn different things of the world by pictures and my art. Preschool decorations includes pictures, alphabets, vowel and anything for them that is easy to pick and learn. This is typically done inside the classroom where teachers use those pictures and arts to have the kids imagine what they learn. It expands their learning ability.</p>

    <div class="heading-services3">Wall Painting</div>
    <div class="image3-services"></div>
        <img class="image3-services" src="Images/wall-painting.jpg" alt="Smily" width="200" height="150">
    <p class="desc-services3"> Wall painting is mostly done outside the school, in the boundry wall. This serves two purposes, one for children playing outside the class to learn as they play thorugh those art and design and another puspose is for the advertizement. People who are walking on the street may recognize that may be interested to have their kids go to that school. Its more of a attention catcher.</p>

    <div class="heading-services4">Banner</div>
    <div class="image4-services"></div>
        <img class="image4-services" src="Images/potrait.jpg" alt="Smily" width="200" height="150">
    <p class="desc-services4"> Banners are arts that are done on a piece of cloth. It is more of a temporary work. For example, if you have a program or function that is only held a couple days and you want to make sure people know about it. So you decide to make a temporary flash bhanner for could of days use, and that can be hanged anywhere you want. After the programs over, you can easily take that banner off ans put it aside. This is a temporary work, so this is very economical.</p>
